First Rust hands-on project

Problem: a guessing game. 
Solution: Program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will compare inout with the generated integer & indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
